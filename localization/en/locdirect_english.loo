The 1400s were the dawn of the golden age of new discoveries and free spirits: the late Middle Ages. Under the rule of the bourgeoisie and petite bourgeoisie, increasing numbers of towns were emerging from the rule of the aristocracy and achieving independence, power and wealth. New businesses were flourishing, bringing financial might and political influence to a thriving economy. However, life in the narrow, overpopulated alleys and streets of the towns had its downside: epidemics and diseases were spreading, and thieves and highwaymen were waiting in line to grab what they could for themselves. The times were perfect for anyone seeking a life of thrills and adventure, as this was an exciting new era.\n\nHow about you?

The Roman Catholic church was in total disarray, with disputes, intrigues and uprisings being commonplace, and the ancient barriers between citizens and noblemen were also crumbling. With some dignity, good luck and wealth, even merchants and craftsmen were now able to join the ranks of the influential and powerful.\n\nThis is the environment you will experience when you enter this medieval world to found your own dynasty.\n\nWith this second game in The Guild series, you immerse yourself in a life simulation as the main character and master of your own destiny. You must use stealth and cunning to create a new dynasty, but beware: your opponents will always be waiting for you around the corner. Marry someone beautiful, make new friends and allies and learn new skills that will help you and your descendants climb the ladder to success!

A new soundtrack was even composed specifically for the game. This particular expansion had a great impact on fans.\n\nThe Guild 2: Renaissance begins in the last days of a dark age, when the clergy and nobility had a stranglehold over the whole of Europe, and the vast wealth of a few noble families was obtained through the blood and sweat of the poor commoners. However, when you start the game at the close of the 14th century, the first rays of a shining new era are appearing on the horizon. Common artisans and traders are gaining wealth and influence, and increasing numbers of people are learning to read and write. This is the dawn of the Renaissance, an age of change when the “common” people are gaining valuable individual freedoms and an age where trade and art are beginning to flourish. The Guild 2: Renaissance is the awakening of a fascinating age of change in society. Could you be part of this challenging new era?";

The gameplay is realistic, but uses the cultural setting of the European Middle Ages to infuse a sense of destiny into the lives of the inhabitants, namely through religious zeal and a desire to leave their mark on society. Unlike other RTS where the player manages armies, you will govern a dynasty using commercial and political means to achieve the highest office in the region. Your family dynasty must last for centuries, so you can gain even more power!

Starting richer than someone else doesn’t necessarily make the game easier for you, as it means the spotlight will be on your family and the other families may tend to >gang up< on you. Starting with a low-level character enables you to begin small and build yourself up from there.\n\nMaps created by the community may be more extreme in their offer of gameplay experiences and the game system can support a wide variety of possibilities, so we expect the community to exploit these opportunities to the full, but we can’t comment on the best way to play these unsupported maps.\n\nHowever, we have attempted to balance the official maps and gameplay paths to provide comparable challenges and experiences. The crafting professions are generally easier to start than service-based professions like the rogue, but you can progress more quickly.\n\nIn the long run, we expect players to combine multiple skills, professions and actions that will best suit them anyway, so although the initial choices are important in the first minutes of gameplay, you will then develop your dynasty in the direction you choose based on what’s happening around you, so the initial choices will become less important.";

Moreover, many historians view the fall of Constantinople in 1453 as the end of the Middle Ages, paving the way for an era of change, discoveries and inventions that had a deep and lasting impact on the world.\n\nThe 15th century also gave rise to new monarchies. The Tudor dynasty was established in England in the wake of the War of the Roses; Ferdinand and Isabella were first introduced as king and queen of Spain, and Charles IX was crowned in France. The clergy also started playing a significant part in the lives of most people, even though its influence was showing signs of weakening. But a new class also emerged in the 1400s: the Bourgeoisie, consisting of mayors, merchants and craftsmen fighting back against the aristocratic rulers, and which was working hard and manoeuvring to gain more political power.\n\nThe 15th century also saw the rise of towns, and commerce and long-distance trading became safer and therefore more profitable. This helped pave the way for the discovery of America and the Cape of Good Hope, the latter opening up an easier and faster route to the East.\n\nThe 1400s were also marked by numerous technological advances in many sectors, including agriculture and navigation. However, no advance had a more profound impact than the invention of the printing press, which helped transform Europe into a society where knowledge was suddenly much more widespread.\n\nCulturally speaking, the 1400s saw major achievements in music, literature and architecture, among others, and teaching the Bible and ancient philosophers, such as Aristotle, were routine in universities. The Renaissance encouraged Humanism and the Liberal Arts, thus shaping the intellectual landscape throughout that era, and this is the world you’ll experience when you play The Guild 3.

Instead, you will be required to manage a dynasty which involves numerous family members, because your character is not immortal. You must therefore appropriately manage the lifespan, businesses and resources of a character while preserving the family’s legacy and building a dynasty! The intention is to encourage you to not only focus on decisions that will determine your short-term goals, but also on a long-term strategy. In addition, as your character is mortal, you will have to choose an heir from amongst your children to continue the family’s legacy. But this brings the added benefit that, as time passes, your dynasty will become increasingly educated and skilled, so your main character will continually expand their abilities.\n\nBut the concept of >winning< is difficult to define for a game like The Guild 3. This is a sandbox game, so as long as your dynasty survives you can continue playing for many hours, even if you’re the only human player in the game!

A male or female character will also be treated in exactly the same way by the system and the other families. However, you do need to make two choices when creating your character that will have a significant impact on the gameplay itself.\n\nFirst, how you allocate your skill points will determine your character’s general abilities, i.e. if they will be more intellectually or physically oriented, or have some kind of charming quality. These abilities are used when an action is performed that could either fail or succeed at various levels; pick-pocketing in the marketplace, for example. The higher the ability score of the character, the higher your chances of a profitable outcome. Of course, you only have a limited amount of points to allocate (8), so think carefully when deciding the kind of character you want to play.\n\nSecond, the starting skill you choose will determine your initial profession, and you can use your experience points to gradually unlock multiple branches of the skill tree and play different professions and businesses simultaneously. But first, you’ll have to embark on your career using the skill you have chosen to play with. Different maps provide different opportunities and make some skills harder or easier to obtain depending on the context, so choose wisely!\n\n-Name: All the members of the dynasty will bear the family name, including your future spouse and children, and the family name will be used to identify the dynasty’s buildings, court cases and other family-related activities in the city.\n-Gender and voice: Easy: you now have to choose the gender (male or female) of your character and their voice (choose from 2-3).\n-Story mode: When starting the game, you can select an objective for your character. The story mode gives you six choices: accumulate wealth, find a lover, become a renowned speaker, become a noble, own a mansion or become the sovereign. Or you can simply adopt a “wait-and-see” approach, and not choose anything, but work out what you want to do as you progress in the game.";

Once your character has married, the spouse’s experience points are given to you (see Children’s Economic and Bargaining Value).\n\nTo win the hand of someone in marriage, you must first court them (and their fathers!). Remember: we don’t discriminate between male and female characters in The Guild 3, and female characters have the same status as males and can court male suitors, own the same businesses and be elected to political office. Courting is carried out as an exchange of pleasantries (compliments, kisses, gifts, etc.) with the intended spouse to increase the chance of agreeing to the union. This scale can also be raised by “courting” the father (with compliments and gifts).\n\nMarriage itself is a trade, namely that you will have to “buy” your spouse from the spouse’s father. If the relationship looks promising, and everyone is in agreement, the price may be very low. However, depending on the “worth” of the spouse, your own worth, your relationships and titles, etc., the “lesser” member of that union may have to include various gifts, favours and other similar elements to reach a mutual agreement. \n\nYou can also marry someone from the “street”, i.e. a person who is not a member of one of the dynasties on the map. While this can be transacted in the same way, through courtship and gifts, the marriage itself takes place when the relationship meter reaches a high enough level, and not after a trade.

Between the ages of 5 and 16, you can send the child to school to educate them in various skills and can give them items that will boost their skills over time (see: children’s experience).\n\nA child’s abilities are based on the combination of both parents’ skills, with some random elements for good measure (see the abilities section below). The child will inherit the father’s skills upon his death, as knowledge is passed down through the generations. Even if a child isn’t physically present in the game until they reach 15 and are of the age to become the heir, a child can be targeted for kidnapping or other actions by an opposing dynasty and the level of security that applies to the dynasty residence also applies to the child.\n\nWhen a child reaches 16 years old they may be courted by someone for marriage. The head of the family always determines the outcome of any marriage proposals, significant gifts and the compliments that are made.\n\nIf you are fortunate enough to have more than one child and have selected an heir, you can also agree to the marriage of the remaining children who are aged 16 and over. At the age of 18, you can appoint your remaining children to political positions, if you have the relevant skill, and thus control more than one position at a time. You will have to choose between your unmarried children aged 16 and over who will assume the position of head of the family when you die. If the heir hasn’t reached 16 at the time of your death, a tutor will assume this responsibility until the child comes of age (see: tutor under character/mortality).\n\nThe heir will inherit the skills of the parent as they were when the parent died, as every head of a dynasty keeps diaries and passes knowledge down to their children. Physical possessions, e.g. businesses, also remain in the family, but political offices do not; these become vacant. The noble titles are granted to the entire family and remain unchanged, so the child therefore continues the dynasty. The children have a combination of abilities based on the levels of the father and mother, so the need to “marry well” (i.e. to someone who has a high level of skills) becomes an important gameplay element.

This neighbourhood has its own AI entity that governs how the population in it will shop, their relationships with the various dynasties and if and why it would rebel, etc.\n\nIn The Guild 3, the concept of neighbourhoods is a very important part of how the city behaves and how you should approach some of your decisions.\n\nA neighbourhood comprises a series of streets, businesses and family residences all grouped together, each with their own values, look and behaviour. The way these values manifest themselves will have an impact on your games in various ways. \n\nFirst, is the concept of the values that are central to how each group behaves. Societies, for instance, have specific values that govern their view of the world; the Thieves’ guild won’t have the same philosophy as a Guardsmen’s Guild for example. These philosophies will be central in determining how they approach a potential new member or enemy - they will judge the player’s family based on the family’s actions in the past to see if their view of the family coincides with their own.\n\nVillages and city districts generally exhibit the same behaviour, so a “posh” noble area will behave very differently to that of a crime-ridden slum near the docks. This behaviour will decide how the population treats you based on how they judge your family’s actions. If your philosophies are similar, the neighbourhood will support you - the population will shop at your businesses, will apply pressure if you have committed a crime there and will also support you if you’re an elected official. \n\nOn the contrary, if your values differ from the values of the neighbourhood in which you live, the population will do the opposite. All of this can escalate to the point at which they rebel against you and riot in front of your house and even burn it down. \n\nThat said, as your family’s values change over time based on the actions you take and the kind of dynasty you create, the neighbourhood’s values will also alter. New buildings will gradually be constructed, old ones will be demolished, the composition of the population will shift and, in an ideal world, the values will eventually be compatible with yours.";

The 1400s were a time when the old feudal system was slowly moving towards a more humanitarian ethos, and you’ll be able to see some of these effects in various aspects of the gameplay. Ultimately, however, it all boils down to how the population feels about you.\n\nIf the population agrees with the things you’re doing and building, i.e. if you share the values of the neighbourhood in which you are carrying out all these actions, then the population will support you in various ways and will buy products in your businesses, pressurise politicians into voting for you in political affairs, show clemency if you’re accused of a crime and will consider your enemies as their enemies. \n\nBut if the population doesn’t like you, either because your actions are having an adverse effect on their neighbourhood or because you’re trying to bring businesses and products into their neighbourhoods that are at odds with their values, then the citizens will not only do the opposite of all the above (not shop at your business, apply no pressure on those working against you), but may also riot, come to your house with torches and pitchforks and try to drive you out of town. This is, of course, in the most extreme cases, but routinely checking your relationship with the various elements in the city (available in the map panel) is a good habit to adopt!";

This system comprises 6 values that have their own score, and each may be affected by the actions you take. Consequently, the score of each value results in a “personality” which determines the diverse aspects of the AI to create a more realistic gameplay. Values are not to be considered as morally “good” or “bad”, but will help you understand that your decisions have repercussions on the environment, economy and the behaviour of your characters. Furthermore, you can analyse and discern the values of the various environments and the behaviour of the characters to enable you to adapt your decision-making process accordingly, and therefore use this information to your own advantage and pave the way for more rapid progress in the game.\n\nYou will be ranked in each of the values over the course of a game and the score will be based on your actions and the various items you build, etc.. So, whether you are aware of it or not, you will have inadvertently created your own “personality” and will therefore attract a society with a similar set of values later in the game.\n\nThe set of values within a district will determine the type of environment it will be which, in turn, will influence the categories of businesses in it and their outcome. For example, a district considered to be a slum will have more spy hideouts and the competition between them will therefore be fiercer. They will earn less, will be less likely to get caught due to the absence of the guards, but will be more accepted by the population, whereas a baker will find his prospects of success much less promising. On the other hand, if you add guard posts to that district the values will, in the long term, change and therefore the same baker will have a better chance of success.\n\nMoreover, dynasties that are controlled by an NPC will also have a value score, and will be utilised by the AI to govern how the NPC behaves in the city. A detailed description of the NPC-driven dynasty behaviour is contained in the AI section.\n\nFinally, business or city improvements such as parks, fountains or statues, have their own values and will therefore gradually affect a district and the city.";

However, as you progress and accumulate experience points, you will eventually climb up the social ladder to reach the higher echelons.\n\nYour character’s progression relates to the game mechanics and you will gradually discover the mechanics in a logical and systematic order. The game mechanics are divided into three major sections, which are directly associated to the three social classes in the game, and are: commoner, citizen and noble. Each section will enable a specific set of mechanics for you and will also introduce those in the next stage. Like a staircase, every “step” will intensify in complexity as you rise up the social ladder, and will prevent you from being bombarded with information and options that leave you confused or lost. Moreover, this process simplifies your learning process in the game. Here is a description of the three sections of the social classes:\n\nCommoner\nYour character starts on their doorstep, a Poor House, that enables you to generate all the basic activities, but you cannot hire employees or research advanced skills, etc.. This is where you learn about commerce, the basic products, all the game controls, etc.. Once you have accumulated the required amount of gold by creating products or performing some actions that generate income, you will be able to buy a business in the city and, in so doing, you will become a citizen and will be free to enter and leave the city as you wish.\n\nCitizen\nYou can now start a business. Once this step is completed, you will be able to hire employees, open more businesses and start interacting with the other inhabitants of the city. This is where you will learn about management (of businesses and employees) and trade (long-distance trade, market routes, etc.). You can now build a city house.\n\nNoble\nOnce you have attained the rank of the nobility, you will be assumed to be managing your businesses automatically, so you rarely have to do this yourself unless something terrible happens, generally the result of the actions of a competitor. However, you will always be able to micromanage your business if you want to. The rank of a noble enables you to participate in the political aspect of the game in your quest to either unseat every other dynasty or become the sovereign yourself. And you can now, of course, build a noble house.";

So it could be a good strategy to stockpile certain kinds of resources and products during the summer months, especially if you own warehouses or large areas of storage. This will enable you to take advantage of the fluctuating prices in the other months of the “year”.\n\nAnother element of the seasons and the effects are the events relating to weather, i.e. droughts and unusual harvests.

Those circled in green are “discovered”, which means that you selected them or have studied them long enough to unlock them.

If your skill requires you to have already unlocked others, the game will select the entire line of required skills. These will then turn blue, indicating that they’re under consideration, and you can modify the line at any time. You may select a skill and see that it doesn’t turn blue or green, in which case, check the requirements for that skill, because the skill may demand a specific social title to unlock it. It could also be that, when selecting a skill to unlock, you have already accumulated enough experience points to immediately achieve your objective. If not, every new point you earn will go towards unlocking that skill. If you modify your selection midway through, you will not lose any accumulated knowledge in that skill, and the points for that skill will remain when you select it again. \n\nCheck every skill and every social level, and the extended tooltip will display everything this skill level unlocks, e.g. actions, items to craft, professions or other bonuses. Once you have unlocked an action, it will appear in the action bar when you are in the right context to use that action. If it is an item to craft, the action will appear in your production menu for the relevant building where you can craft that item. Bonuses are applied right away, and new building types appear in the new building window when you are able to commence building in the city.\n\nSimilar to the character creation section of the manual, the skills are divided into two categories (basic skills already covered above and advanced skills) and they follow the same three steps of gameplay complexity contained in the game.";
